**Project Name:** BharatSaarthi - Offline Voice-First AI for Rural India

**Tagline:** An AI system that acts as a digital village helper, guiding citizens through healthcare, farming, and government services — without internet and in local languages.

**Problem:**
65% of India lives in rural areas with poor internet connectivity and low digital literacy. Existing AI solutions are internet-dependent, text-centric, and English-focused, making them inaccessible to 800M+ rural citizens.

**Solution:**
BharatSaarthi is an offline, voice-first AI assistant that works without internet, in local languages (Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali), across three critical domains:
- 🌾 Agriculture: Crop disease diagnosis, fertilizer advice
- 🏥 Healthcare: Vaccination schedules, basic health guidance
- 🏛️ Government: Scheme eligibility, document requirements

**Innovation:**
- Completely offline (no internet needed)
- Voice-native design (not text-adapted)
- Multi-domain knowledge base
- Hybrid NLP (rules + ML) for accuracy
- Only 200MB total size
- Works on low-end Android phones

**Technical Stack:**
Python, TensorFlow Lite, Vosk (STT), pyttsx3 (TTS), SQLite, Flask

**Impact:**
- Target: 800M+ rural citizens
- Market: ₹10,000 Cr+ opportunity
- Social: Bridges digital divide, enables informed decisions

**Demo:**
Open index.html in any browser for interactive demo. No installation required.
